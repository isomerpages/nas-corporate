# **Children’s Season 2021**

Can you imagine what life was like for the people of Singapore during the Japanese Occupation (1942–45)? A lot of people had to endure many hardships and difficulties during those years. 

 

This Children’s Season, we’ve organised a follow-up edition of online activities “at” the Former Ford Factory. Parents and children* will learn about life during the Japanese Occupation, and the hardships and resilience of our forefathers as well as listen to powerful survivor stories through our oral history interviews. Find out more about these activities and join us! 

 

*Suitable for children aged 7 – 12 years old

 

You can also look out for a variety of activities and educational programmes for children and families to enjoy at the Museum Roundtable museums and online. Themed “Fantastic Critters & Where To Find Them”, children can look forward to collecting uniquely-designed critter stickers at the 15 participating museums, and learn more about the artefacts and stories that inspire the critters. Parents can also refer to the consolidated list of programmes on the Children’s Season webpage, to plan for museum visits across the end-of-year school holidays.

After the surrender of the British, Singapore was renamed Syonan-to, or “Light of the South”. Along with this name change came the Nipponisation of Singapore. Nipponisation, or Japanisation, was a process where the Japanese tried to make the people of Singapore act and think more like them and embody the Japanese spirit. Buildings and roads were given Japanese names and school teachers even had to learn Nippon-go so they could conduct their classes in Japanese!

In addition to making people learn Nippon-go, the Japanese military wanted people to adopt other aspects of Japanese culture, such as bowing and wearing the kimono.

**Reflections:**
1.	How do you think the people of Singapore felt about having to learn a new language so suddenly? Imagine you are a student during the occupation and that you must now learn Mathematics, but in Japanese. Would you be able to cope? 
2.	Radio taiso was a form of exercise that school children had to do before their classes began.  Watch a video of it here.
3.	Did you know that Singapore’s local time was changed to follow the time in Tokyo, Japan? What impact do you this this had on the residents of Singapore?

There was a strong Japanese military presence in Singapore and there were many checkpoints across the island. Getting through these checkpoints was quite an ordeal. Locals had to present proper documentation to pass through these checkpoints and also had to bow to the soldiers there. Not doing so meant that they risked getting slapped, punched or even detained.

 Besides these inconveniences, the supply lines to Singapore were disrupted because of the war and many foodstuff and essential items could not reach the island. The Japanese tried to ration the goods that were available for purchase but this was insufficient in meeting demands and soon, a thriving black market emerged.
