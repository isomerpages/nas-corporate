**The Fall of Singapore** 

The first bombs dropped on Singapore on 1 February 1942, shortly after 4am. Japanese planes and naval ships bombed Chinatown, Raffles Place, and the Seletar and Tengah airfields. 

2 weeks later, and after very intense fighting, the British troops were exhausted and were low on supplies such as ammunition, petrol, water and food. Lieutenant-General Arthur E. Percival then made the difficult decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese.

**Surviving the Occupation – Food Shortages**

After the British surrender, Singapore was renamed Syonan-to, or ‘Light of the South’. The Japanese Occupation was a difficult period for the people who suffered greatly. 

Food shortage was a common occurrence during wartime and people had to grow their own food to survive. Some of the food grown include tapioca, sweet potatoes and bananas. People also had to get creative in the kitchen, as they cannot afford to let any food go to waste.
