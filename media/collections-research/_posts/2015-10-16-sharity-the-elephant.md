Sharity, a pink elephant in blue dungarees, has been the ambassador for Community Chest since 1 October 1984. An amalgamation of the words ‘Share’ and ‘Charity’, Sharity was the brainchild of the Community Chest’s public education committee to teach children the concept of caring and sharing. The campaign targets primary and lower secondary school students.

During Children’s Day and Youth Day in 1984, Sharity donation envelopes were distributed to students and the funds collected were channelled to the Community Chest. In 1984, for every $1 donated, 27 cents went to help a person with a disability; 26 cents for an elderly in need; 20 cents to aid a needy child; 19 cents to help an individual or family in distress; and 8 cents to help the sick.

Sharity was created by Terry Herbert, a copywriter from advertising agency McCann Erickson in New Zealand. The first sketch of Sharity was drawn by a student from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts which was later modified by an ad agency artist.

Sharity has since been featured in numerous publicity materials, merchandise and events either alone [or together with friends like Lanky Giraffe, Lavender Lamb and Mick Monkey](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/4dfd5294-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad). The iconic mascot was given a makeover in 2011 to increase its appeal to the younger generation.
