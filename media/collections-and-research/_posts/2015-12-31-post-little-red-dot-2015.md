# LITTLE RED DOT, 2015

As Singapore celebrates its 50th National Day, the use of archives has reached record levels. An unprecedented number of books, exhibitions, film or television productions and other heritage projects on Singapore have been created and published using photographs, audio-visual recordings, oral history interviews, maps, posters and other materials from the National Archives of Singapore (NAS).

NAS has been a happy part of this creative output as Singaporeans have looked for the things that they remember, searched for things forgotten and made surprising new discoveries. Here at Archivist Pick of the Week, we have attempted to celebrate everyday things familiar to Singaporeans by highlighting some archival records in the past year.

Shortly before the start of 2015, NAS was approached to do something creative with a difference. [Supermama](http://www.supermama.sg/), an award-winning Singapore design label, proposed the exciting possibility of working with a collective of 50 designers, architects, artists and illustrators coming together in a single project. Their artwork would be presented within hand-crafted porcelain artefacts and the inspiration would be found in archives.

We were delighted to agree to this artistic engagement – something totally new for NAS.  A set of 50 archival records, some of which you can view here, was selected by Supermama and they ranged from plans of national monuments to everyday things such as bus tickets and receipts for sewing machines. It was then intriguing to see the creative re-interpretations and imaginings as they started to come in. Some were anchored on shared collective memories we can all identify with, others on deep personal recollections; some took on serious tones while others were quirky and lively.
