# THE RONNI PINSLER COLLECTION

[Grace Ho](http://www.nas.gov.sg/blogs/offtherecord/author/nlshgs/) 4 Years Ago 4 Min. Read

Mr Ronni Pinsler is an independent photographer who has made invaluable contributions to Singapore heritage by documenting the nation’s changing landscape between the 1970s and 1990s. He is best known for his extraordinary efforts recording the multifaceted practices of local Taoism and has captured many valuable images of Singapore, focusing on vanishing local street scenes and people portraits. He received the prestigious Supporter of Heritage award from the National Heritage Board in April 2010 in honour of his generous permanent loan of a comprehensive collection of his work to the National Archives of Singapore.

Mr Pinsler is best known for his extraordinary efforts in recording the multifaceted Taoist religion of Singapore and Malaysia, with its pantheon of deities and myriad rituals. He has also devoted much effort in capturing other striking images of Singapore society and landscape from the 1970s and 1980s, much of which has since vanished, like , from changing street scenes, vanishing trades, to Chinese funeral rites, traditional Chinese Opera and other cultural practices.

Mr Pinsler’s interest in Singapore’s culture began in the early 1970s, when he began exploring the streets of Singapore, befriending local people from all walks of life- shopkeepers, hawkers, Chinese opera actors, secret society members, and Taoist temple priests, to discover more about their everyday lives. This interaction led him to take a special interest in Taoist practices. He sought and gained access to various local Taoist temples, whose officials allowed him to document their customs, and he was eventually invited to sit on the committees of several of these temples like the then Leng Hiang Twa Temple at Clarke Quay. Today, he is respected as an authority on Taoist practices and for his insights into the local culture of Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s. His photography was showcased in An Illustrated Cycle of Chinese Festivals in Malaysia and Singapore a book written by CS Wong and published by Jack Chia-MPH in 1987

Of particular importance is Mr Pinsler’s extensive photography on Taoist rituals and deities. Many Taoist rites have been captured step by step in his work, allowing them to be seen in sequence. Mr Pinsler’s annotations in which he names many of the deities in the extensive Taoist pantheon are a great value-add to his images.
