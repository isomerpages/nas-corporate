There was also a strong focus in the second decade on improving the quality of our reservists, i.e. those Singapore citizens who had completed their full time National Service. By 1984, reservists accounted for 80 per cent of Singapore’s armed forces, or about 200,000 soldiers. Thus the effectiveness of the nation’s military depended on having fit, motivated and well-trained reservists.

Reservists were reminded that they were Singapore’s front-line military force and not a mere second-line “reserve”, and that they were counted on as defenders of the nation even as they went about their civilian lives.

In-camp training was made more vigorous and streamlined to save time and increase training intensity. Promising reservist soldiers were promoted and sent for advanced military training to upgrade their skills. The best reservist officers were selected for training at the SAF’s prestigious Command and Staff College, which previously admitted only senior career officers.

Efforts were made to improve the fitness levels of reservist soldiers, as many lost their physical conditioning after returning to civilian life. A new physical fitness test called the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) was introduced in 1980 to ensure that reservists upkeep their physical fitness.

To raise the morale of reservists and recognise the crucial role they played in Singapore’s national defence, our Government also established the first two permanent Singapore Armed Forces Reservist Association (SAFRA) clubhouses at Toa Payoh and Bukit Merah. The clubhouses provided quality meeting places for reservists to meet up with one another and were generously furnished with first class sport and gym facilities to encourage physical fitness.

We have been given the duty to defend our country.

In order to win the respect of the public, in particular, of those who are national servicemen or reservists, our regular corps of soldiers must impress them with a sense of commitment to their profession and to the country.”**[1]***

Reservists taking the IPPT fitness test. The test was medically designed to check a soldier’s strength, agility and endurance and comprised of five exercises – pull-ups, sit-ups, shuttle-run, standing broad jump and a 2.4 km endurance run. When it was first introduced, soldiers had to take the test every six months and pass it, or face a remedial training programme. *Pioneer, courtesy of NAS.*
