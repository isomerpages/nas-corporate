Centrepoint, a shopping centre along Orchard Road, used to worry parents of angst-ridden teenagers, especially when its name was used in conjunction with ‘kids’. The terms ‘Centrepoint kids’, ‘Daimaru kids’, ‘Far East kids’ were bandied about in newspapers and television features during the mid-1980s, describing teenagers who turned up by the hundreds at these complexes, ‘sporting carnival colours and avant-garde hair-do[es].’

Breakdancing was the rage in 1980s and Orchard Road was the central of the fad. The fifth-storey corridor at Centrepoint, with its mirrors, was a hotspot for those seeking to practice their moves, until chased away by security guards.

They had gathered to watch a breakdancing session organised by the owner of a record shop in Far East Plaza. Despite a prior cancellation of the event due to complaints from shopkeepers, some youths had brought along their own portable cassette players, intending to dance anyway.
