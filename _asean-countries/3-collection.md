#### MAP OF SINGAPORE ON 83 KEY LOCATIONS

This map and an accompanying booklet contain annotated photographs on 83 key locations in Singapore town that were photographed and documented by Japanese informants and spies before the war. They were used to identify locations of Japanese interest, to spare them from attacks during the invasion.

#### AIR RAID PRECAUTION SQUAD IDENTITY CARD 

The Air Raid Precautions department was formed in 1938, and by November 1939, had successfully recruited about 3,500 wardens. They were trained to provide information and assistance during air raids and drills and were mobilised when the first bombs landed in Singapore in the wee hours of 8 December 1941.

#### IDENTITY CARDS 

In 1941, it was compulsory for all non-military residents of Singapore to carry identity cards under the Defence (Security Registration) Regulations. This was to ensure that the government was able to screen the population for potential spies. These cards were among the first ominous signs of the looming war.
