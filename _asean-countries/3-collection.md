The Air Raid Precautions department was formed in 1938, and by November 1939, had successfully recruited about 3,500 wardens.

#### IDENTITY CARDS 

In 1941, it was compulsory for all non-military residents of Singapore to carry identity cards under the Defence (Security Registration) Regulations. This was to ensure that the government was able to screen the population for potential spies. These cards were among the first ominous signs of the looming war.
