## Law of the Land: Highlights of Singapore’s Constitutional Documents

<img src="/images/exhibitions/Poster.jpg" alt="Law of the Land Exhibition" style="width:450px;"/>


### About the Exhibition

A constitution is a legal document that lays out the structure of government and the fundamental laws and principles governing a country and its people. In Singapore, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is the supreme law of the land that all other local laws must conform to. It prescribes the important distribution of authority between the three arms of the state: the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. It safeguards fundamental rights Singaporeans enjoy, such as equality before the law, equal protection of the law and the freedom of religion, among others. The sovereignty of Singapore is entrenched within the constitution. It has been called a “pragmatic document” that provides the framework for social, political and economic development that helps Singapore thrive.   

  

*Law of the Land: Highlights of Singapore’s Constitutional Documents* explores the history and development of Singapore’s constitution from Singapore’s founding as a British settlement in 1819 to its emergence as a sovereign republic in 1965. 

  

The exhibition features rare constitutional documents from the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Library, Singapore. The documents capture key moments in Singapore’s constitutional history and also throw light on milestones in our island-nation’s history.  

  

The exhibition is held at the historic former Chief Justice’s Chamber and Office at the National Gallery Singapore.

*Law of the Land: Highlights of Singapore’s Constitutional Documents*  is held at the historic former Chief Justice’s Chamber and Office at National Gallery Singapore’s former Supreme Court Wing. 

  

The Supreme Court building and the Chief Justice’s Chamber and Office were designed by the government’s architect Frank Dorrington War and completed in 1939. 

  

The original furniture in the Chief Justice’s Chamber and Office were designed by Mr WH Swaffield from the Municipal Architects’ Department in the Public Works Department. Swaffield designed the furniture in the Istana’s banquet halls and throne room. 

  

Some original antique furniture in the Chief Justice’s Chamber and Office is integrated with the exhibition. These pieces were hand carved by Singaporean craftsmen trained in British workmanship. Teak wood was predominantly used along with top grade leather upholstery.
