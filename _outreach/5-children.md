Did you know that Singapore was once involved a war? Do you know how, why and when it started? Or who we fought against? Food was scarce during the war – do you have any idea what people ate then?

This Children’s Season, we’ve prepared a special edition of online activities “at” the Former Ford Factory (FFF). Parents and children* can learn about life during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore, the hardships our forefathers endured as well as listen to powerful survivor stories. Read on and try these activities for yourself. Enjoy! 

**Suitable for children aged 7 – 12 years old*

The first bombs dropped on Singapore on **8 December 1941**, shortly after 4am. Japanese planes and naval ships bombed Chinatown, Raffles Place and the Seletar and Tengah airfields. 

By February the following year, the British troops were exhausted and running low on supplies such as ammunition, petrol, water and food. British Army Commander, Lieutenant-General Arthur E. Percival, then made the difficult decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese.

The official surrender took place on **15 February 1942** at the Japanese military headquarters located at the Ford Factory in Upper Bukit Timah.

**Reflections**

1. How do you think the people of Singapore felt towards the British and Japanese after the British surrender of Singapore? 

2. An air raid siren was sounded to warn people of an impending attack. Have you heard an air raid siren before? Click [here](https://youtu.be/UkjZmjzvpBo) to listen to two types of warning sirens used in Britain during World War II. How do you feel when you hear it? 

3. Did you know that Total Defence Day coincides with the surrender date of 15 February every year? Does the Total Defence siren today sound the same as the air raid sirens of the past? Click [here](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/public-warning-system) to listen to the Total Defence siren.
