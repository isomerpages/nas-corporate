<h2>Laws of Our Land: Foundations of a New Nation</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>ABOUT THE EXHIBITION</h3>
<p>About seven decades ago, the identity and legal status of Singapore citizens
did not exist, wives in Singapore were not treated as equal partners in
marriage, and Singapore’s archaic employment laws were unsuited for a modern
industrial economy. But all this changed with the introduction of three
laws that are featured in a refreshed exhibition by the National Library
Board (NLB).</p>
<p><strong><em>Laws of Our Land: Foundations of a New Nation </em></strong>puts
a spotlight on the Citizenship Ordinance, the Women’s Charter, and the
Employment Act. Through the 37 artefacts and reproductions on display from
the collections of the National Archives of Singapore, the National Library
and partner institutions such as Singapore's Supreme Court, and a host
of multimedia and interactive features, visitors will learn about the historical
background and circumstances that led to the passing of these laws.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of the Three Laws:</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Citizenship Ordinance</strong> (1957) created the legal status
of Singapore citizen and paved the way for Singapore to become a self-governing
state and later an independent nation-state.</p>
<p>The <strong>Woman’s Charter</strong> (1961) introduced a unitary monogamous
law to govern non-Muslim marriage and protection of the rights of women
and has been the legislation at the core of Singapore family law.</p>
<p>The <strong>Employment Act</strong> (1968) modernised Singapore’s labour
laws to meet the needs of the new industrial economy and remains Singapore’s
main labour law regulating the basic terms and working conditions for employees
in Singapore.</p>
<p>These laws serve as foundation pillars of our nation by continuing to
shape and underpin the rights and identities of Singapore’s citizens, women
and workers.</p>
