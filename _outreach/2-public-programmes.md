Part of our Outreach efforts involves organising exciting programmes for the public. These programmes are usually organised at a permanent gallery at the Former Ford Factory managed by the National Archives of Singapore which showcases memories of life during the Japanese Occupation. We hope to engage the public through the fun activities we organise and at the same time, educate visitors of Singapore's history during our darkest hours. Who says history can't be engaging? Many participants had told us that the entire family loved joining us in the programmes and had a blast while learning about our shared past!


Take a look at some of our past public programmes below. Get excited and look out for future programmes under [Calendar of Events!](http://www.nas.gov.sg/nas/Outreach/CalendarofEvents.aspx)

  ### Children's Season 2016 - Little Archivist for a Day

  Have you ever wondered what happens to the old maps or documents and photographs of the past? How are they conserved and where are they kept? How do we learn about incidents or events that took place in Singapore's history? On 18 and 19 June 2016, participants aged 9-13 years old got to experience being an archivist through fun and engaging hands-on activities.
