### Archives Invites: Everyday Modernism and Sources for the Ordinary

Everyday Modernism: Architecture and Society in Singapore is the first comprehensive documentation of the city-state's modern built environment. Through a series of building biographies, the book uncovers the many untold histories of the Southeast Asian city-state's modernisation, from the rise of iconic buildings, such as the Pearl Bank Apartments, the former PUB Building and the Jurong Town Hall, to the spread of ordinary typologies like the condominium, the multi-storey car park, the podium-tower block, the flatted factory, the community centre, the standardised school building, the pedestrian overhead bridge, and the columbarium.  In this talk, Chang Jiat Hwee and Justin Zhuang will share how they researched the book using different textual and visual sources. They will focus on the use of a few lesser known magazines and the different types of government publications to write a more inclusive history of the built environment in Singapore.
