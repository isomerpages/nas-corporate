### Archives Unlocked: Film Preservation of Memories

From brand new 16mm experimental works to 8mm home movies from the 1930s, all types of film have organic components, which, like all organic material, are subject to decay. So what can we do to preserve the films that we might have stored on our shelves or in drawers and boxes?

Over the past several decades, film archives around the world have discovered new techniques for preserving film, but many are prohibitively expensive or too complicated for individuals with small collections and limited resources. Join NAS’ Sound and Moving Image Lab Senior Specialists, Edwin Francis Van Huizen and Joe Ng, as they offer a look at how films are handled at the Archives and explain the main factors that determine the stability of motion picture film, and give recommendations relating to their inspection and handling, cleaning and repair, and preparation for storage and storage conditions.
