### Archives Invites: Dr Mok Kin Wai Patrick & Chew Tee Pao

##### Practice as Research: Learning Chinese Martial Arts for the Creation of Dance Pieces

Chinese martial arts is an ephemeral representation of intangible culture, which is difficult to document, archive and transmit, not to mention its tactic knowledge and skills that needed to be first learned before it could be transformed into a dance piece. Based on a case study by Hong Kong Dance Company Ltd., the talk presents how to take a “being-doing-knowing” approach in a project that aims to learn and explore the embodied knowledge of practising martial arts and transform the cultural heritage into a choreographic work. The practice and research would also help us formulate a methodology for the transmission of intangible culture into creative works.

##### The Preservation and Restoration Journey of Ring of Fury

Inspired by the 1970s kungfu craze sparked by Bruce Lee, _Ring of Fury_ (1973, Tony Yeow & James Sebastian) is Singapore’s first and only martial arts film. It starred a practising Singaporean Kyokushin karate master, Peter Chong. Banned for more than 30 years, the film was largely unseen until 2017 when the Asian Film Archive (AFA) restored the film from a sole surviving film print. AFA’s archivist will share the challenges in preserving and restoring the film, the impact to the advocacy of preservation, and the experience of reintroducing the restored film to new audiences.

##### **In conjunction with this Archives Invites talk, the film** **_Ring of Fury_** **will be screened at NAS Oldham Theatre on 24 May, 8pm**

Tickets to be purchased on Asian Film Archive’s [website](https://asianfilmarchive.org/). 

(Ticket sales will be opened at a later date. Please check back again for the AFA ticket sales link.)

### Archives Unlocked: Conserving J.T Thomson Maps

### Archives Invites: Everyday Modernism and Sources for the Ordinary

Everyday Modernism: Architecture and Society in Singapore is the first comprehensive documentation of the city-state's modern built environment. Through a series of building biographies, the book uncovers the many untold histories of the Southeast Asian city-state's modernisation, from the rise of iconic buildings, such as the Pearl Bank Apartments, the former PUB Building and the Jurong Town Hall, to the spread of ordinary typologies like the condominium, the multi-storey car park, the podium-tower block, the flatted factory, the community centre, the standardised school building, the pedestrian overhead bridge, and the columbarium.  In this talk, Chang Jiat Hwee and Justin Zhuang will share how they researched the book using different textual and visual sources. They will focus on the use of a few lesser known magazines and the different types of government publications to write a more inclusive history of the built environment in Singapore.

### About the Speaker

Besides _Everyday Modernism_ (2022), his books include _A Genealogy of Tropical Architecture_ (2016), _Southeast Asia’s Modern Architecture_ (2018), and _Non West Modernist Past_ (2011).

**Justin Zhuang** is an observer of the designed world and its impact on everyday life. The journalism graduate has authored numerous articles and books on Singapore design and its built environment. He is also the co-founder of the writing studio and publishing imprint, In Plain Words.
