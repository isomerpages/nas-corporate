### Archives Invites: Dr Imran bin Tajudeen -New Findings on Town Malays in SG

Join Dr Imran bin Tajudeen as he highlights fresh research into Malay organisations in Singapore using both newspaper articles and archival records. He will explore the kinds of associations that were formed, their locations, activities, and the debates that occurred ranging from exhortations for social upliftment and unity, to contestations over ethnicity and advocacy for changes to the colony's policies. These findings offer new perspectives on the civic life of the Town Malays in colonial Singapore, the personalities involved, the historical use of the term Peranakan, the range of Muslim associations, and the connections across Malay and non-Malay groups in colonial Singapore across time.
