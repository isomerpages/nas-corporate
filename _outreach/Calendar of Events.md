### Archives Unlocked: The Pirate Music Trade in 20th-Century Singapore


Post-war Singapore was a hotbed of musical activity, which witnessed an unprecedented explosion in new musical styles, local music groups and multinational and independent record labels. As demand for the latest music records grew, a pirate trade took hold and flooded the market with locally-manufactured bootlegs. Join Assistant Archivist Jamie Lee as she traces the history of the 20th-century pirate music trade, and learn the differences between authentic and counterfeit records in the National Archives of Singapore's collections.
