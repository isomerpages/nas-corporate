### Archives Invites: Dr Ho Chi Tim – Public Histories of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore
While the Japanese Occupation of Singapore might have taken place more than 70 years ago, its impact still resonates today. The memories of survivors have been internalised by the public through various communicative forms. The Occupation is regularly commemorated by the State and the preceding invasion upheld as a key milestone in the Singapore Story. 

Over time, these public representations have created distinct impressions of the Occupation, some of which may not immediately be congruent with academic scholarship on the topic. Join Dr Ho Chi Tim as he delves into issues arising from public and academic representations of the Japanese Occupation, and how they are part of an understated public history discourse in Singapore.
