### Archives Unlocked: Film Preservation of Memories

From brand new 16mm experimental works to 8mm home movies from the 1930s, all types of film have organic components, which, like all organic material, are subject to decay. So what can we do to preserve the films that we might have stored on our shelves or in drawers and boxes?

Over the past several decades, film archives around the world have discovered new techniques for preserving film, but many are prohibitively expensive or too complicated for individuals with small collections and limited resources. Join NAS’ Sound and Moving Image Lab Senior Specialists, Edwin Francis Van Huizen and Joe Ng, as they offer a look at how films are handled at the Archives and explain the main factors that determine the stability of motion picture film, and give recommendations relating to their inspection and handling, cleaning and repair, and preparation for storage and storage conditions.

### Archives Invites: Dr Marcus Tan and Lim Ting Li - The Sounds of Singapore

Sound can be considered as an intangible cultural heritage. It can reveal a society’s social character and inform a people’s sense of place. In collaboration with NAS, the research project “Aural Heritage: Developing a Singapore Sound Map as Cultural Archive” sought to curate ambisonic soundscapes for SoundscapeSG. In this talk, Dr Marcus Tan and Lim Ting Li will explore soundscapes as a way of understanding Singapore’s culture and everyday life. They will share their experiences and posit considerations for the curation of sound, and further explain why sounds should be archived.

### About the Speakers
