### Archives Invites: Phan Ming Yen - Better than a Gun or Revolver – Music as Protection and Collaboration in Wartime Singapore

Presented by writer, producer and arts manager Phan Ming Yen, this talk explores the role of music during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–1945) and how it might have been a form of protection and means of survival for many locals.
