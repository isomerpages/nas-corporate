### Archives Invites: Dr Ho Chi Tim – Public Histories of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore
While the Japanese Occupation of Singapore might have taken place more than 70 years ago, its impact still resonates today. The memories of survivors have been internalised by the public through various communicative forms. The Occupation is regularly commemorated by the State and the preceding invasion upheld as a key milestone in the Singapore Story. 

Over time, these public representations have created distinct impressions of the Occupation, some of which may not immediately be congruent with academic scholarship on the topic. Join Dr Ho Chi Tim as he delves into issues arising from public and academic representations of the Japanese Occupation, and how they are part of an understated public history discourse in Singapore.

**Tue, 22 Feb 2022**

Rating: PG

Made during the golden era of Malay cinema, and inspired by heroic folklore, Sergeant Hassan is a patriotic film that reimagines military and civilian struggles during the Japanese occupation. The legendary P. Ramlee stars in the titular role as a young man who leaves his village to join the Malay Regiment where he rises up the ranks, succeeds in battle and brings peace and victory to his nation and community.

A rare document of Singapore cinema, Spirit of the Overseas Chinese was made by pioneering female Chinese filmmaker Wan Hoi-Ling, who had directed films in Singapore for the Shaw Brothers. Her partner Hou Yao, who tragically died during the war, collaborated with her on her films. Made just a year after World War II ended, the film begins before the war comes to Malaya and reflects upon the struggles of newly-emigrated and affluent Chinese immigrants who have to choose between the comfortable luxury of their lives in Singapore and returning to their motherland to fight the enemy. Restored by the China Film Archive and subtitled by the Asian Film Archive.
