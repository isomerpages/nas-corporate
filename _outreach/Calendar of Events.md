### Archives Unlocked: Broadcasting in SG –Stories from TV Archives Since 1990s

### **那些年，我们一起追的节目2**

过去的三十年里，新加坡广播电视经历多次改革，如1994年新加坡广播局私营化和2000年电视媒体自由化。继“那些年，我们一起追的节目”，彭莱娣博士将在这次的讲座中探索新加坡广播电视自上世纪90年代以来的发展与改革。她也将通过国家档案馆的声像档案，带您重温当年脍炙人口的好节目。本讲座将以华语进行。

The Singapore media landscape has undergone various transformations since the mid-1990s. Join Dr Phang Lai Tee for her second talk on Singapore’s broadcasting history, as told from the audiovisual archives in the National Archives. The talk in Mandarin will trace the transition of broadcasting in Singapore from a government function to a privatised service, and the impact of the media liberalisation in the early 2000s. **Programme will be conducted in Mandarin.**

### Archives Invites: Dr William Gibson – Keramat in Singapore
Drawing on his recent Lee Kong Chian Research Fellowship study of keramat (sacred shrines) in Singapore, Dr William L. Gibson discusses the site-specific methodology he deployed in his research. He will share how layering different resources such as archival texts, site visits, oral histories, property records, and digitally manipulated maps and photographs, create new insights into the history of keramat sites in Singapore. He will also highlight examples from both well-known and obscure keramat sites.

### About the Speakers
Dr William L. Gibson is an author, researcher and educator based in Southeast Asia since 2005. He is the recipient of a 2021 Lee Kong Chian Research Fellowship, awarded by the National Library Board, where he conducted an in-depth study of keramat in Singapore. He has published both scholarly works and historical fiction with Routledge, NIAS Press and Monsoon Books, as well as articles and essays in _Signal to Noise_, PopMatters.com, _The Mekong Review_, _Archipel_, _History and Anthropology_, _Bulletin de l’École française d’Extrême-Orient_ and _BiblioAsia_, among others.
