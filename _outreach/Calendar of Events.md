### Archives Invites: Dr Marcus Tan and Lim Ting Li - The Sounds of Singapore

Sound can be considered as an intangible cultural heritage. It can reveal a society’s social character and inform a people’s sense of place. In collaboration with NAS, the research project “Aural Heritage: Developing a Singapore Sound Map as Cultural Archive” sought to curate ambisonic soundscapes for SoundscapeSG. In this talk, Dr Marcus Tan and Lim Ting Li will explore soundscapes as a way of understanding Singapore’s culture and everyday life. They will share their experiences and posit considerations for the curation of sound, and further explain why sounds should be archived.
