### Archives Invites: Dr Nick Aplin – Sport in Singapore: Forgotten Heroes and the Malaya Cup

Join Dr Nick Aplin, Deputy Director of Sports Heritage at Sport Singapore, as he examines the development of sport in colonial Singapore through the game of football. The Malaya Cup was introduced in 1921 and was the catalyst for the creation of a national game. Players who honed their football skills in Singapore went on to represent China at the 1936 Olympic Games. Even during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, the game was sustained, enabling young players to thrive post-war in the late 1940s and 1950s. Together with badminton, weightlifting, swimming and water polo, football helped to create a golden age of sport in Singapore. Many Malaya Cup heroes have been forgotten, and their contributions to Singapore sport should be acknowledged.

### About the Speakers

Dr Nick Aplin is the Deputy Director of the new Sport Heritage Division at Sport Singapore and a Singapore permanent resident. He was involved in PE (physical education) teacher education at the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University until 2020 when he made the transition to his current role. Dr Aplin is the author of “Sport in Singapore: The Colonial Legacy” (2019) and his new book “Sport in Singapore: The Rocky Road to Kallang Park” is slated to be released later this year.

### Archives Invites: Rio Furqan Saini –Role of Emotion in Fashion Image-Making

Emotions are an indelible part of the human condition but they are often not a central part of canon or curricula, much less in pedagogies for fashion image-making. Geographies of Emotion (GOE) is an exploratory journey into the role of emotion in fashion image-making, constructed through a relational transformative pedagogy in which the research is grounded. Supporting this research are case studies gleaned from student projects that create emotive video works of the same name and fashion imagery from local fashion magazines. 

The objective of this study is to consider how GOE decentres the fashion image as one that is merely surface-level and repositions it as a vehicle for artmaking that engages emotions. It is facilitated through a broader pedagogical strategy that not only imbues students with technical competencies, but also calls them to embrace emotion as a way to make and re-make meanings about the world and their place within it through the fashion image.

### About the Speakers

Rio Furqan Saini is an award-winning multi-hyphenate polymath who wears multiple creative hats. Creative consultant, visual artist, fashion director and fashion educator, his work has led him to create evocative works that engage and challenge preconceptions of the fashion image. With 20 years of experience under his belt, his main practice and philosophy of his craft of image-making in fashion is the juxtaposition of outward visual spectacle with introspective, intimate storytelling.

### Archives Invites: Broadcasting in SG –Stories from TV Archives Since 1990s
