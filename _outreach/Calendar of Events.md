### Archives Invites: Michael Flecker: SG Maritime History- Shipwreck Evidence
Much is now known of Singapore’s thriving 14th-century Temasek Period from texts and archaeological findings. With the recent discovery of the _Temasek Wreck_, which was almost certainly bound for this entrepôt, our understanding is further enhanced. However, the long spell from the 15th until the 19th century remains cloudy.

The distant, but linked _Binh Thuan Wreck_ can provide some illumination. Two decades before Raffles’s arrival to Singapore, the colossal _Shah Muncher_ was lost in Singapore waters mid-voyage from Canton to Bombay. While only passing by, her cargo can still tell us much about life and trade in the early port of Singapore.

### About the Speaker
Dr Michael Flecker started working life in 1985 as a civil engineer in a Singapore-based company. Two years later he changed course, signing up as diving supervisor for the two-year excavation of the Manila Galleon, Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion, in Saipan. He then founded Maritime Explorations and went on to direct some of the most important shipwreck excavations in Asia, spanning a millennium from the 9th to the 19th centuries. He earned his PhD from the National University of Singapore, based on his excavation of the 10th century _Intan Wreck_, and specialises in ancient Asian ship construction and maritime trade. Apart from new archaeological findings, he has written extensively on ethics, politics, legislation and pragmatism in the troubled realm of underwater cultural heritage in Southeast Asia.

### Archives Unlocked: Brief History of Transcription in the Oral History Centre

Oral history practitioners have long been concerned with whether interviews should be transcribed, and to what extent, especially when it comes to the available technology of the time. Learn how the Oral History Centre has adapted from its typing pool beginnings in the 1980s, to the dream of video recordings in the 1990s and the voice-to-text revolution in the 2010s.

With the surge of virtual conferencing software and artificial intelligence capabilities since the COVID-19 pandemic, where will we go next?

### About the Speaker
John Choo is an Assistant Specialist at the Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore. As an oral history interviewer, he has conversed with religious practitioners, charity employees, corporate volunteers, community leaders, and para-athletes. A significant number of these conversations took place during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the use of remote audio-visual platforms and other digital technologies, incorporating automated transcription features.
