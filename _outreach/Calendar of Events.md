### Archives Invites: Shaun McGuire – The Royal New Zealand Air Force Leaves Singapore: Records Hindmost!

New Zealand’s contribution to the defence of Malaya in 1942 was the Royal New Zealand Air Force Squadron 488 and an Aerodome Construction Unit. The two units had the good fortune of leaving Singapore shortly before the island’s fall, sparing many of its men from internment by the invading Imperial Japanese Army.

Considered low to no priority, the units’ records were left behind or lost as the forces evacuated to the Dutch East Indies. The records (and photographs that had chanced to survive) from this campaign were largely compiled after the war and now reside at the Archives New Zealand. Join Archivist Shaun McGuire as he highlights some of these records.

### About the Speaker
Shaun McGuire is an archivist with 20 years’ experience supporting researchers in Archives New Zealand and at New Zealand’s Heritage Library, Alexander Turnbull Library.  He has a Masters in History from the University of Waikato and a Masters of Information Studies from Victoria University of Wellington.

### Archives Invites: Simon Froude – Australia and the Defence of Singapore: Records Held by the National Archives of Australia

The defence and the ultimate fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 had profound consequences for Australia.

The events ended the so-named “Singapore strategy” upon which Australia had been relying for the defence of its continent, leaving it vulnerable to aggression in the Pacific. Some 1,789 Australians were killed and 1,306 wounded during the Battle for Singapore. Fifteen thousand members of Australia’s 8th Division were captured, and of these, more than 7,000 died as prisoners of war. Until the end of the war in 1945, Australians at home had little or no news of the fate of their loved ones, which caused great anguish. 

National Archives of Australia holds a variety of records related to the fall of Singapore and its aftermath. Most significantly, there are records of discussions by the Australian War Cabinet, and cables between the Australian and British governments, discussing events and deploring the loss of Singapore. Documented in those cables is Prime Minister John Curtin’s famous declaration that Australians currently deployed in Europe and Middle East must be brought back to defend their homeland. There are also pre-war records relating to the building of the naval base at Singapore, and Australia’s attempts to track the whereabouts and welfare of Australian prisoners of war from 1942 to 1945.

### About the Speaker
Simon Froude is Director-General of National Archives of Australia. His appointment commenced on 23 May 2022.

Prior to joining National Archives, Simon was Director and State Archivist at State Records of South Australia, where he was responsible for the preservation and accessibility of some of the state’s most important historical records, as well as records and information management, freedom of information and privacy, for the South Australian Government.

As Director-General, Simon is leading National Archives through the next phase of its transformation to ensure it continues as a beacon for best practice management of the official records of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that Australian Government information of enduring significance is secured, preserved and available to government agencies, researchers and the community.

Simon’s driving passion is to improve the accessibility of government records, with a particular focus on improving access to individuals and groups impacted by past government policy. He has extensive experience in archival and records management within the public sector, including at State Records of South Australia and South Australia’s Department of Education and Department of Treasury and Finance.

These findings offer new perspectives on the civic life of the Town Malays in colonial Singapore, the personalities involved, the historical use of the term Peranakan, the range of Muslim associations, and the connections across Malay and non-Malay groups in colonial Singapore across time.
