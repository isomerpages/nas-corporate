### New Light on an Old Tale: 80th Anniversary of the Fall of Singapore
“New Light on an Old Tale” is an exhibition organised by the National Archives of Singapore to mark the 80th Anniversary of the Fall of Singapore (15 February 1942). Showing from 15 February to 30 June 2022, the exhibition showcases artefacts from private collections as well as archival records which hold intimate and little-known stories about World War II and continue to be witnesses to pivotal events that have shaped the history of Singapore

Accompanying the exhibition is a series of related programmes that together present the events of World War II and the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in a new light.

Don’t miss our online sessions with invited speakers who will explore the public and academic representations of the Japanese Occupation, British medals awarded to Singaporeans for their service in World War II, and music as protection and collaboration in Wartime Singapore. 

Join us for a guided tour of the Former Ford Factory to discover its history and significance, and a talk to learn about the role of Oral History accounts in battlefield history.

Catch a P Ramlee Malay classic set during the Japanese Occupation and two rare 1946 post-war Chinese films, curated by the Asian Film Archive.

### Exhibition:

**“New Light on an Old Tale” Exhibition**

**15 Feb – 30 Jun 2022**

**Sarjan Hassan (Sergeant Hassan) (1958)**

Director: Lamberto V. Avallena

Runtime: 112 minutes

Country: Singapore

Language: Malay, Japanese, English with English subtitles

Rating: PG

Made during the golden era of Malay cinema, and inspired by heroic folklore, Sergeant Hassan is a patriotic film that reimagines military and civilian struggles during the Japanese occupation. The legendary P. Ramlee stars in the titular role as a young man who leaves his village to join the Malay Regiment where he rises up the ranks, succeeds in battle and brings peace and victory to his nation and community.
Released a year before Singapore gained full internal self-governance from the British, the film can be viewed as a projection of a nation’s desire and perseverance to attain independence and foster harmony among its people.

Director: Wan Hoi-Ling

Runtime: 94 minutes

Country: Singapore

Rating: PG

A rare document of Singapore cinema, Spirit of the Overseas Chinese was made by pioneering female Chinese filmmaker Wan Hoi-Ling, who had directed films in Singapore for the Shaw Brothers. Her partner Hou Yao, who tragically died during the war, collaborated with her on her films. Made just a year after World War II ended, the film begins before the war comes to Malaya and reflects upon the struggles of newly-emigrated and affluent Chinese immigrants who have to choose between the comfortable luxury of their lives in Singapore and returning to their motherland to fight the enemy. Restored by the China Film Archive and subtitled by the Asian Film Archive.

### Archives Invites: Dr Ho Chi Tim – Public Histories of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore

While the Japanese Occupation of Singapore took place more than seventy years ago, its impact still resonates today. The memories of survivors have been internalised by the public through various communicative forms. The State regularly commemorates the occupation and the preceding invasion as key milestones in the Singapore Story.

Over time, these public representations have created distinct impressions of the occupation period, some of which may not immediately be congruent with academic scholarship on the topic. Join Dr Ho Chi Tim as he delves into issues arising from public and academic representations of the Japanese Occupation, and how they are part of an understated public history discourse in Singapore.

### About the Speaker
Dr Ho Chi Tim is a historian of Singapore and Southeast Asia, with research interests in the histories of social welfare, colonialism/imperialism and public history. He has published works on various aspects of Singapore’s history including social services, nation-building and archival research, and was involved in several public history projects. Chi Tim is currently a lecturer at the Centre for University Core, Singapore University of Social Sciences.

### Archives Invites – Bennett Sng: British Medals Awarded to Singaporeans for Their Service in World War II

Similar to their British counterparts, military, police, other uniformed personnel and civilians who were involved in World War II in Singapore were awarded British medals for their contributions. During this session with collector Bennett Sng, listen to the stories of some of these gallant men and women and find out more about the history of medals in Singapore since 1918.
Check out some of these medals at the exhibition “New Light on an Old Tale” held at the National Archives of Singapore from 15 Feb to 30 Jun 2022.

### About the Speaker
Mr Bennett Sng is a Singaporean in his late 50s currently working as a trainer in the government sector. His interest in collecting and researching medals started in the late 1990s when he realised that there were only a handful of Singaporeans who shared the same interest. He has since co-organised a few medal exhibitions to share his collections with fellow Singaporeans. His most recent exhibition, “Fragments of Voices”, was held from 2017 to 2020.

### Archives Invites – Phan Ming Yen: Better than a Gun or Revolver: Music as Protection and Collaboration in Wartime Singapore

Presented by writer, producer and arts manager Phan Ming Yen, this talk explores the role of music during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–1945) and how it might have been a form of protection and means of survival for many locals.

### About the Speaker
