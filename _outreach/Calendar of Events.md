### Archives Unlocked: Grassroots Movement in Singapore – A Personal Account

Grassroots organisations use collective action at the local level to effect changes at the local and national levels. They are associated with bottom-up decision making and encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their communities.

While much has been written about the history and functions of the different types of grassroots organisations in Singapore, less is known about the personal experiences of those involved.

Started in the mid-2000s, this oral history project allows individual grassroots leaders to express how and why they joined the movement, share their passion, challenges and experiences in serving residents, and give first-hand accounts of how grassroots organisations work and developed over time. This project will also document the lessons learnt by grassroots leaders in Singapore’s changing social, economic, political and cultural environment.

### About the Speakers
**Mrs Kiang-Koh Lai Lin** is a consultant at the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). She was a former director at the National Library Board, heading its reading initiatives. Since joining the Oral History Centre at NAS, Mrs Kiang-Koh has covered extensively grassroots leaders’ interviews.

**Kevin Khoo** is a Senior Manager (Documentation) at the Oral History Centre. He is an experienced Archivist with a background in research, curation and corporate planning.

### Archives Unlocked: Face-to-Face, Breath-to-Breath - Rediscovering the Value of Human Touch in a Zoom-bified World

Since Singapore’s Circuit Breaker in 2020, most of us have endured months of physical separation from friends and family, connected primarily through screens and other technologies. Come listen to excerpts of accounts collected by the Oral History Centre (OHC), which document how this separation has affected individuals from all walks of life, and how we as a people have tried to take it in our stride and carry on.  Join OHC Specialists Sheerin Mustapa and John Choo as they explore if digitalisation can truly replace our being together.

### Archives Invites: Dr Nick Aplin – Sport in Singapore and the Malaya Cup

Join Dr Nick Aplin, Deputy Director of Sports Heritage at Sport Singapore, as he examines the development of sport in colonial Singapore through the game of football. The Malaya Cup was introduced in 1921 and was the catalyst for the creation of a national game. Players who honed their football skills in Singapore went on to represent China at the 1936 Olympic Games. Even during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, the game was sustained, enabling young players to thrive post-war in the late 1940s and 1950s. Together with badminton, weightlifting, swimming and water polo, football helped to create a golden age of sport in Singapore. Many Malaya Cup heroes have been forgotten, and their contributions to Singapore sport should be acknowledged.

### About the Speakers

Dr Nick Aplin is the Deputy Director of the new Sport Heritage Division at Sport Singapore and a Singapore permanent resident. He was involved in PE (physical education) teacher education at the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University until 2020 when he made the transition to his current role. Dr Aplin is the author of “Sport in Singapore: The Colonial Legacy” (2019) and his new book “Sport in Singapore: The Rocky Road to Kallang Park” is slated to be released later this year.
