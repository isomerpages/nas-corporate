From a paper record repair workroom in early 1969 with 2 binders, the Archives Conservation Laboratory (ACL) has expanded to 7 permanent staff today. This small team is devoted to conserving paper-based archival records which dates back to 1800s, covering materials such as manuscripts, bound volumes, maps, architectural drawings, photographs, to posters. 

Conservation is a laborious and painstaking process given their age and condition, requiring meticulousness and an eye for details. Conservation covers not only the physical repairs, but also include appropriate housing, handling, transport, and preventive measures such as environmental control and monitoring, integrated pest management, and emergency preparedness. 

ACL strives to upkeep professional standards by adhering to international conservation code of ethics and principles, and maintains continuous professional development.
