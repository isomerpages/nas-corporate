From a paper record repair workroom in early 1969 with 2 binders, the Archives Conservation Laboratory (ACL) has expanded to 7 permanent staff today. This small team is devoted to conserving our substantial holding of Straits Settlements Records which dates back to 1800s. This is a laborious and painstaking process given their age and condition

The machines and equipment that ACL uses have also evolved from simple tools to more sophisticated ones. Some of these have been designed in-house e.g. the leaf casting machine, encapsulation machine, hydraulic press machine and pulping machine. Computer aided software is also used to enhance precision and effectiveness in the conservation processes.

 

In advancing conservation practices, ACL has been working closely with experts from overseas conservation and archival bodies.
