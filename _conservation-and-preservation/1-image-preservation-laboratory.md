The Image Preservation Laboratory provides digitisation and imaging services to government agencies, as well as shares its expertise with overseas institutions through visits, practical attachments and workshops. We preserve paper records (which are digitised) and born-digital records for posterity. These records are also written onto microfilm to ensure their continued and long-term accessibility.
