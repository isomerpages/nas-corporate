The Sound and Moving Image Laboratory conserves, digitises and preserves audiovisual recordings. Older media such as audio and film reels and analogue video tapes that are in NAS’s holdings are cleaned and digitised; systems are built to ingest new formats (such as HD); and the constant need to migrate digital files into newer formats is systematically done to ensure that nothing is lost to technological obsolescence.
