At the National Archives of Singapore, we are as passionate about our work as we are in enjoying ourselves. Our people come from various backgrounds, equipped with different expertise and though we are in different departments overseeing the conservation and preservation of records, we frequently come together as one NAS family to celebrate many festivals and events.

Here are some snapshots of our people from the past to the present.
