    section-description: On 3 June 1959, the 1.6 million people in Singapore awoke to a new beginning - as people of a fully internal self-governing city state under the British Crown.

The new government thus needed to encourage them to establish roots in Singapore, and to foster a sense of pride, loyalty and national identity.
