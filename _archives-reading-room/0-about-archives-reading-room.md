The Archives Reading Room (ARR) is the primary physical space where researchers and members of the public seek access to archival records. Our duty officers address enquiries and attend to the research needs of the public, academics and government agencies. Researchers can request to view and reproduce copies of records subject to prior approval if this is required from transferring agencies and donors and in compliance with NAS’ terms. The ARR holds reference copies of records in microfilm and digital formats which include Straits Settlements Records, private records, maps, building plans, cemetery, marriage and school records and records from overseas archives.

Please submit a request via Archives Online ([www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/)) by clicking the Request to View button and fill out the online form before visiting the Archives Reading Room. You may also write to [nas@nlb.gov.sg](mailto:nas@nlb.gov.sg) before visiting to enquire about our holdings and availability of records at least 5 days before your visit.

The Archives Reading Room is located at 1 Canning Rise, Singapore 179868.
