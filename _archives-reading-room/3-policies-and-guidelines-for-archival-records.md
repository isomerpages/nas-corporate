At the Archives Reading Room (ARR), only copies of records are available for viewing and the original records are not retrieved in order to minimise handling and movements of records to ensure their long-term preservation. Researchers can request to view, cite and reproduce copies of records subject to prior approval if required from transferring agencies and donors and compliance with NAS’s terms. There are no charges for viewing of records. However, a fee is charged to recover cost of copies made at ARR.



Researchers should submit their requests online **before** their scheduled visit for us to advise on the availability of the records, or if further clearances are required before viewing. Please visit [Archives Online](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/) and click on the “Request to View” button on the records of interest.
