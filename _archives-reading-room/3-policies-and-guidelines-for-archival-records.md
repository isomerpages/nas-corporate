At the Archives Reading Room (ARR), only copies of records are available for viewing and the original records are not retrieved in order to minimise handling and movements of records to ensure their long-term preservation. Researchers can request to view, cite and reproduce copies of records subject to prior approval if required from transferring agencies and donors and compliance with NASâ€™s terms. There are no charges for viewing of records. However, a fee is charged to recover cost of copies made at ARR.
